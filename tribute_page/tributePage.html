        <h2>Here's a time line of Shaheed Bhagat Singh's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong> - Shaheed Bhagat Singh was born on September
            27th ,1907. Singh was influenced by a number of incidents during his
            childhood which established a deep sense of attachment to the
            independence of India in him.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1919</strong> - Bhagat Singh visited Jallianwala bagh at the
            age of 12. A lot of people gathered in a public meeting and they
            were fired upon by the British government without any warning,
            killing hundreds. Bhagat Singh witnessed the whole event watching
            the deaths of many innocent people and who were victims of
            discrimination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1924</strong> - He ran away from his house to Cownpore from
            his family to avoid getting married. It is also belived that he went
            to Cownpore to attempt to free kakori train robbery convicts from
            jail, but returned to Lahore for unknown reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928</strong> - Bhagat singh took vow to take revenge of
            Lala Lajpat Rai's death who led a silent protest but the police
            responded with violence. Singh joined other revolutionaries to plot
            the death of James A. Scott. Scott was the superintendent of police,
            he ordered the police to Baton charge the protesters. The plot of
            killing Scott went wrong and Singh killed J.P Saunders instead.

            <strong>1929</strong> - He and Batukeshwar Dutt threw two bombs in
            Central Legislative Assembly. And were then arrested. After they

            protest this. They demanded equality in standards of food, clothing
            ,toiletries, and other hygienic necessities.
